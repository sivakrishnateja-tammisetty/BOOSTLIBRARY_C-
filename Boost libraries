                                                              INTRODUCTION

*Boost  C++ libraries  are collection of modern libraries based on standard c++.
The source code is released under the Boost Software License, which allows anyone to use, modify, and distribute the libraries for free. 
The libraries are platform independent and support most popular compilers, as well as many that are less well known.

*RAII stands for Resource Acquisition Is Initialization. 
 The idea behind this idiom: for any resource acquired, an object should be initialized that will own that resource and close it in the destructor. 
 Smart pointers are a prominent example of RAII. They help avoid memory leaks.


1.1 Boost.SmartPointers:
    --------------------
  *Boost.SmartPointers defines smart pointers. Some of them are provided by the C++11 standard library. Others are only available in Boost.

  *The library Boost.SmartPointers provides various smart pointers. They help you manage dynamically allocated objects.
    There can’t be a memory leak if, for example, you forget to call delete.

1.2 Boost.PointerContainer:
    ------------------------
  *Boost.PointerContainer defines containers to store dynamically allocated objects – objects that are created with new. 
    Because the containers from this library destroy objects with delete in the destructor, no smart pointers need to be used.

1.3 Boost.ScopeExit:
    ----------------
  *Boost.ScopeExit makes it possible to use the RAII idiom for any resources. While Boost.SmartPointers and Boost.
  PointerContainer can only be used with pointers to dynamically allocated objects, with Boost.ScopeExit no resource-specific classes need to be used.

1.4 Boost.Pool:
   ------------
  *Boost.Pool has nothing to do with RAII, but it has a lot to do with memory management. This library defines numerous classes to provide memory to your program faster.
